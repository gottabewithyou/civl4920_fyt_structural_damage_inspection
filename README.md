## Novel Structural Damage Inspection Using an Integrated Ai-Image-3D Point Cloud Approach

Supervisor: Prof Xiao Pan

Routine inspection and maintenance of civil infrastructures are crucial to ensure structural integrity, normal functioning of public infrastructure systems, regional resilience against natural disasters, and long-term social and economic development. Traditional infrastructure inspection relies on human inspectors, which is inefficient, labour-intensive, and inherently biased. With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer graphics, computer vision and 3D point cloud techniques have gained great traction for digital twin-supported structural damage inspection. In this study, we will develop and apply autonomous structural inspection methods, using state-of-the-art theories in the field of AI, computer vision and 3D data processing. Students are required to use Python programming together with multiple libraries such as OpenCV, PyTorch, Hugging Face, etc., as well as Unity 3D. Specifically, the students will be engaged in the following tasks:

- A comprehensive literature review of the recent studies on image- and point cloud-based inspection of civil infrastructure, particularly those involving multimodal language models (e.g., vision-language models).
- Data curation, augmentation, and synthesis from existing datasets using generative AI methods.
- Structural condition assessment using AI-driven computer vision and 3D point cloud methods.
